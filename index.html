            <td> In this individual project, I engineered two deep learning models—an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Residual Neural Network—specifically designed for predicting molecular energies within the ANI1 dataset. To enhance the models' understanding of molecular structures, I employed the Many Body Tensor Representation, a method encoding structures through a distribution of various structural motifs. Leveraging Python packages, including numpy, scikit-learn, and PyTorch, implemented and fine-tuned both the ANN and ResNet models.  <a href="https://github.com/koreogundele/chem277b-final-project">View GitHub repository</a></td>
            <td> As an active participant in a collaborative team effort, I played a key role in modeling air quality across US counties, employing a combination of data analysis and machine learning techniques, notably linear regression. My responsibilities included data cleaning, thorough analysis, and the construction of a linear regression model. This contribution enhanced model accuracy by 5%. Leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, my team successfully conducted a comprehensive analysis of emission data. The application of these tools allowed for the development of a predictive air quality model, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring. <a href="https://github.com/EnviroTechSean/TeamPunchParty">View GitHub repository</a></td>
